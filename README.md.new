## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- MySQL or compatible SQL database
- The dataset file: `dataset/spotify-2023.csv`

### Setup
1. Create the database and import the data:
   ```sql
   mysql -u username -p < schema.sql
   ```
2. Import the CSV data into your database
3. Run the SQL scripts in the `scripts/` directory

## Usage

Each script in the `scripts/` directory demonstrates different analytical capabilities:

- **Basic Analysis**: `01_general_song_information.sql`
- **Platform-Specific Analysis**: `02_spotify_metrics.sql`, `03_apple_music_metrics.sql`, `04_deezer_metrics.sql`
- **Advanced Analytics**: `10_correlation_analysis.sql`, `11_popularity_analysis.sql`
